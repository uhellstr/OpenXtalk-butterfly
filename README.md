A couple of years ago I was really into retroprogramming and did some Assembler and Basic programming on C64.
One of the programs I wrote in Basic was the Butterfly Demo.

This demo you can view on Youtube on the following URL:

This version is like my Pixels Demo written so it is resolution independent. It means it works on both Desktop (Mac,Windows,Linux,Raspberry Pi)
but also on Mobile Devices like Andriod and iOS. I have succesfully compiled and installed the code on Nexus 7.
